# WP Command Center — Session Handoff (2026-06-18)

> **Purpose:** continuity doc for future sessions. Captures release state, audit findings, product decisions, and priority order **after STEP 109**.
> **Type:** documentation only. No code, no commits, no deploy in the session that produced this.
> **Companion docs:** [`UX-AUDIT-AND-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`](UX-AUDIT-AND-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md) · [`PRODUCT-MASTER-PLAN.md`](PRODUCT-MASTER-PLAN.md) · `HANDOFF-STEP-109.md` (repo root).

---

## 1. Current release state

- **STEP 109 (Dashboard Overview, 109.1–109.3): COMPLETE, RELEASED, PRODUCTION-VERIFIED.**
- **Tag `v0.109.0`** = commit **`079496a`** = `origin/main` = local HEAD = **production server HEAD** (0 ahead / 0 behind; working tree was clean at release).
- **Deploy model:** pull-cron (Hostinger) on `mosharafmanu.com`; `git push origin main` → live ~1 min.
- **Production verification (SSH wp-cli + anonymous HTTP):** deployed HEAD `079496a` · `git describe` = `v0.109.0` · plugin active · `/admin/dashboard` 404→**401** (auth-gated) · admin page 302 · homepage + namespace 200 · no 500s.
- **Invariants on production (unchanged):** OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.4.0**.
- **Test posture at release:** `test-dashboard.sh` 114/0; sibling admin suites clean; T1 `--changed` 97/0 net-new 0; **pristine serial T2 4353/24 net-new 0** (112 suites; the 24 are the chronic baseline matched suite-for-suite).
- **Phase A (admin read-surface arc, STEP 104→109) is COMPLETE.** All Phase A surfaces are **read-only** (no execution, no write/POST routes, no `OperationExecutor`).

---

## 2. Architecture audit findings (reference index)

From the architecture release audit (severity-ranked). These are the canonical IDs used across the product docs.

### Architectural weaknesses
- **W1** — `OperationRegistry::get_operations()` is a single hardcoded inline array with embedded availability probes, rebuilt every request, no caching. *Severity: high (latent).* Root of the 200+-op scalability story.
- **W2** — **FeatureGate coherence gap:** the Dashboard aggregator calls sub-surface summaries directly **without re-checking each sub-surface's own FeatureGate**. Latent today (all ungated); becomes an info-disclosure bug the moment licensing turns a sub-surface off. *Severity: high (latent), security/consistency.*
- **W3** — **No least-privilege tiering:** every surface gates only on `manage_options`; there is no read-only "viewer" role for a governance/visibility console. *Severity: low/medium.*

### Unnecessary complexity
- **C1** — Six near-identical permission callbacks differing only by FeatureGate key string.
- **C2** — `ApprovalAdminQuery` constructs an `OperationRegistry` in its constructor that `summary()` never uses (dead instantiation on the dashboard hot path). *Severity: low (P3).*
- **C3** — Duplicated security-mode presenter (identical wrapper in `DashboardAdminQuery` and `OperationExplorerAdminQuery`).

### Duplicated concepts
- **D1** — **View-layer JS copy-pasted across every view** (`escHtml`, `apiFetch`, `setHtml`, `sprintf`, `fmtTime`, badge/risk renderers). **Largest duplication in Phase A**; blocks consistent a11y/i18n. *High.*
- **D2** — Data concepts surfaced in multiple places **by design** (the Dashboard rolls up by *calling the owning method*, so drift risk is low). **Accept.**

### Scalability (40 → 200+ ops)
- **S1** — Catalogue rebuilt + re-probed (plugin-active / class_exists / WP-CLI) on every request, uncached. *High (latent).*
- **S2** — Operations Explorer (and Tokens) are **unbounded** (no `LIMIT`/offset/cursor); Operations Explorer loads all ops client-side and filters in JS — diverges from the platform's own pagination contract. *Medium-high.*
- **S3** — Token surfaces scale super-linearly: per-token access matrix is `O(tokens × operations)`; `tokens()` unbounded. *Medium.*

### Maintainability
- **M1** — `AdminRestApi` is a ~1169-line monolith with 26 routes + 6 permission callbacks (all five surfaces share one controller). *Medium.*
- **M2** — View-layer JS duplication (same root as D1) → an N-place edit for any security/i18n fix. *Medium.*
- **M3** — Catalogue-as-inline-array (same root as W1) → adding an operation edits a giant literal; merge-conflict + readability cost. *Medium.*

### UX findings
- **UX-1** — No product identity (raw WP `widefat`/dashicons chrome). *High.*
- **UX-2** — Two "Dashboards" (legacy operational + read-only Overview) with different data. *High.*
- **UX-3** — Menu sprawl (~12 submenus, no IA grouping). *High.*
- **UX-4** — No onboarding / readiness state.
- **UX-5** — No persistent task launcher / command surface.
- **UX-6** — Inconsistent micro-UX (each surface reinvents filters/tables/states).
- **UX-7** — Silos; no cross-linking between Approvals ↔ Changes ↔ Operations ↔ Tokens.
- **UX-8** — Reversibility (rollback) is buried inside Change History detail rather than first-class.

## 4. Decisions already made (locked)

1. **WPCC is evolving into an *AI Operations Platform for WordPress*** — operate, control, audit, approve, monitor, roll back, manage AI activity.
2. **Governance remains the core moat** — the Four Guarantees are inviolable for every capability.
3. **We will add user-facing AI capabilities** — WPCC is no longer governance-only; it becomes a **Governed Action console** (Propose ≠ Apply).
4. **Builder Mode + Engineer Mode approved conceptually** — one product, two lenses (density + disclosure over shared data).
5. **Command Design System (CDS) approved conceptually** — versioned, themeable by one `brand.accent`, do-not-fork; shared across a future plugin family + a governance spine.
6. **No backward-UX-compatibility constraint** — legacy surfaces may be retired (keep URL redirects for bookmarks only).
7. **Major navigation restructuring is allowed** — collapse ~12 submenus into a branded shell + the 5-C IA (Overview · Operate · Audit · Access · Connect).

---

## 5. Current priority order

### P0 — Inviolable (never regress, in any phase)
- **Preserve the Four Guarantees** on every capability:
  - **Approval** (risk-tiered, security-mode aware, human-in-the-loop)
  - **Rollback** (reversibility, or explicit guarded irreversibility)
  - **Audit** (attributed: human / system / agent)
  - **Capability scoping** (nothing runs outside the token/capability/least-privilege boundary)

### P1 — Phase B: Platform Hardening & Certification
- **W2** — close the FeatureGate coherence gap (latent security).
- **D1** — extract the shared view substrate (unblocks consistent a11y/i18n).
- **S1** — catalogue caching / stop re-probing every request.
- **S2** — pagination consistency for Operations Explorer + Tokens.
- **S3** — token-surface scaling (access matrix).
- **C1** — consolidate the duplicated permission callbacks.
- **C3** — consolidate the duplicated security-mode presenter.
- *(carry-along: W1 catalogue-as-registry, W3 least-privilege role, C2 dead instantiation.)*

### P2 — Pre-transformation groundwork
- **Feature Inventory** — full catalogue of existing surfaces/operations/capabilities as the source of truth for migration.
- **Migration Map** — legacy slug → new 5-C section/route mapping (with redirects), so navigation restructuring is deterministic.

### P3 — Phase C: UX & Design System
- **CDS implementation** (tokens → component kit → migrate surfaces → freeze v1).
- **UX redesign** (branded shell, single menu, 5-C IA, unified dashboard, command palette, onboarding).
- **Builder / Engineer modes** (density + disclosure toggle).

### P4 — Phase D/E: AI Workbench capabilities
- **Governed Action console** + scheduling + notifications + policy templates + metering (Phase D).
- **AI-assisted multi-step workflows** + command-palette intent mode (Phase E).
- Every capability ships **through** the P0 Four Guarantees — no parallel ungoverned path.

## 6. Recommended next prompt for a future session

> **Suggested opening prompt:**
>
> "Read `docs/product/SESSION-HANDOFF-2026-06-18.md`, `docs/product/PRODUCT-MASTER-PLAN.md`, and `HANDOFF-STEP-109.md` completely. Confirm the release baseline is still `v0.109.0` (HEAD == origin == tag == prod, tree clean) and invariants are 34/23/40/40/2.4.0.
>
> Then begin **Phase B — Platform Hardening & Certification**, report-first. Produce a REPORT-ONLY remediation plan for the P1 debt in priority order — **W2, D1, S1, S2, S3, C1, C3** — that preserves the Four Guarantees (P0) and all invariants. For each finding: the fix's product intent, blast radius, the invariants/guarantees it must not disturb, and a phased, test-gated sequence (`--changed` T0/T1 net-new 0 → pristine serial T2 → deploy on explicit direction). Do not write code, modify files, or propose STEP 110 implementation until the plan is approved."

This keeps the discipline intact: **report-first → phased build → net-new 0 vs `tests/regression-baseline.tsv` → deploy on explicit direction**, with the Four Guarantees and invariants as the non-negotiable backstop.

# STEP 110 — Proposal Store + AI Alt Text (Governed Action #1) — milestone

> Added after the Proposal Store primitive (Tasks 1–6) and AI Alt Text (Tasks 7–8.3) were built and validated. Committed as one milestone on `main` (not pushed, not deployed).

## Proposal Store primitive — COMPLETE (Tasks 1–6)
The canonical **Propose** stage of the Governed Action contract — a generic, pre-decision staging primitive that reaches the site only through the existing `OperationExecutor` chokepoint (never a second write/approval/audit/rollback path):
- **Schema:** `wpcc_proposals` table; **DB_VERSION 2.4.0 → 2.5.0** (additive; idempotent `dbDelta`; no backfill).
- **`ProposalStore`** — state-machine repository, **sole writer** of proposal rows (`status`/`request_id`/`change_id`/`error_json`); statuses draft → pending_approval → applied/dismissed/failed (terminal, idempotent).
- **`ProposalApplyService`** — the single execution crossing point (developer direct apply + gated branch → approval).
- **`ProposalOutcome`** — shared executor-envelope interpreter (success / in-band error / gated / hard failure) — the one definition consumed by ApplyService and Sync.
- **`ProposalSync`** — pull-only authority resolver (read-through of requests/results/change_log; lazy materialize).
- **`ProposalReconciler`** — bounded sweep reusing Sync (cron wiring deferred).
- **Proposal REST** — list/get/create/edit(final_payload)/apply/dismiss under `wp-command-center/v1/admin/proposals`, gated by the C1 resolver (`proposal_store` feature key); read-through on GET; rollback-aware presentation.
- **Governed Drafts (Dev) UI** — `wpcc-proposals` admin surface, **build-flag OFF by default**.

## AI Alt Text (Governed Action #1) — COMPLETE through Task 8.3
First user-facing consumer, entirely on the proposal store; apply/undo route through the engine:
- **7A** read-only scan (`AltTextScanQuery`, `GET /admin/alt-text/scan`) — missing/weak/ok audit.
- **7B** provider abstraction (`AltTextProvider`/`ProviderResult`/`ProviderResolver`) + **Anthropic BYO** vision provider (`AnthropicVisionProvider`; key via constant/option; Redactor-scrubbed; outbound isolated; 30s timeout; size guard).
- **7C** `AltTextGenerator` + `POST /admin/alt-text/generate` — provider suggestion → governed **drafts** only (provenance: provider/model/confidence/batch_id/proposed_by).
- **7D** live validation (Anthropic) — quality 9/10, 0 content hallucinations; drafts only.
- **8.1** Builder surface scaffold + **Review tab** (scan/readiness, read-only).
- **8.2** **Suggestions tab** — chunked Generate, edit (`final_payload`), dismiss.
- **8.3** **Approve & Apply** (mode-aware) + **Applied tab** (rollback-aware) + per-image **Undo** (existing rollback route).
- Builder UI is `wpcc-alt-text`, **build-flag OFF by default**.

## Four Guarantees — INTACT
Approval (gated apply → real Approval Center request) · Rollback (existing change-history rollback; rollback-aware status) · Audit (executor/ChangeRecorder; store only reflects) · Capability Scoping (REST gate + executor `media_manage` capability + actor propagation). No second Approval Center / Change History / rollback system; no ungoverned write path.

## Invariants (unchanged across the whole arc)
OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0** (the only intended delta).

## Build flags & local enablers
- Governed Drafts dev UI: **off by default** (`WPCC_PROPOSALS_DEV_UI` const / `wpcc_proposals_dev_ui` filter).
- AI Alt Text UI: **off by default** (`WPCC_ALT_TEXT_UI` const / `wpcc_alt_text_ui` filter).
- Local-only mu-plugins (`wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcc-dev-*.php`) enable these on dev — **outside the plugin repo, NOT committed, never deployed.**

## Testing state (clean env, key removed)
- `tests/test-alt-text.sh` **129/0** · `tests/test-alt-text-ui.sh` **57/0**
- `tests/test-proposal-store.sh` **161/0** · `tests/test-proposal-rest.sh` **23/0** · `tests/test-proposal-admin.sh` green
- `--changed` **T0/T1 net-new 0** throughout.

## Current recommendation
- **Hold deployment** (Builder UI is build-flag off; deploy changes nothing user-facing until flipped — your call).
- **Next task = Task 8.4 Bulk Workflows**, on the committed baseline.

*Milestone committed locally on `main`; not pushed, not deployed.*

# Proposal Store + AI Alt Text milestone — DEPLOYED to production (2026-06-19)

The milestone (`3c37cbf`) was pushed and **deployed to production** via the Hostinger pull-cron (`45971e1 -> 3c37cbf active=yes`). Post-deploy SSH+HTTP verification all green: plugin active · `wpcc_db_version` = **2.5.0** · `wp_wpcc_proposals` table created · invariants **34/23/40/40** (MCP tools verified via live `tools/list`) · dev flags `WPCC_ALT_TEXT_UI`/`WPCC_PROPOSALS_DEV_UI` UNDEFINED → both Builder UIs HIDDEN · no fatals · new routes `/admin/proposals` + `/admin/alt-text/scan` = 401 (live, auth-gated); existing admin routes (`/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/history`, `/admin/operations`, `/admin/tokens`, `/admin/approvals`) = 401. Prod REST ns = `wp-command-center/v1`. Deploy gotcha: hosting account has a STALE second checkout at `~/domains/mosdev.site/.../purple-surgical/` (at `5abea8f`) — prod path is the explicit `~/domains/mosharafmanu.com/public_html/wp-content/plugins/wp-command-center`.

# Task 8.4 — Tier-1 Bulk Workflows — COMPLETE (committed, NOT pushed)

Committed locally on `main` as **`0b74293`** (`feat(ai-alt-text): Task 8.4 — Tier-1 bulk workflows (UI-only)`); **not pushed, not deployed.** Production remains at `3c37cbf`.

**Scope delivered (UI-only, one view file + its test):** Suggestions-tab bulk action bar (scope selector All drafts / Last generated · select-all · Apply selected · Dismiss selected) + per-row checkboxes. Bulk **Apply**/**Dismiss** run **sequentially** over the existing `POST /admin/proposals/{id}/apply` and `/dismiss` — each item governed individually (own approval gate, `change_id`, rollback). Developer → applied; client/enterprise → `pending_approval`. Mode-aware `confirm()`. **Per-item failure never aborts the run**; failed rows kept with a message. Progress in a `role=status` region (processed/total · applied · submitted · dismissed · failed). **Batch-scoped review:** Generate captures chunk `batch_id`s and the view auto-scopes to the last run; `batch_id` used only as an opaque grouping key (never displayed). Per-item Undo unchanged.

**Explicitly deferred (Tier-2):** batch-level approval, atomic batch rollback, async/queue generation, cross-page **server-side selection** (→ **S2**), raising `MAX_BATCH`. No new endpoint/route/operation/capability/MCP tool/schema/batch primitive.

**Files:** `includes/Admin/views/ai-alt-text.php` (+183/−7), `tests/test-alt-text-ui.sh` (+13 assertions).

**Validation:** `test-alt-text-ui.sh` **69/0**; T1 `--changed` **97/0 net-new 0**; invariants live-verified **34/23/40/40/2.5.0**; Four Guarantees preserved per item. Pre-existing env failures (`test-alt-text.sh` 125/4, `test-proposal-admin.sh` 24/1) confirmed identical at the clean `3c37cbf` baseline (Anthropic key present + dev mu-plugin flags ON) — **0 net-new attributable to 8.4**.

**Next:** S2 — Selection & Pagination Consistency (architecture review first; this is the prerequisite for cross-page/server-side bulk selection).

---

# STEP 111 — Task 8.4 Bulk Workflows + S2.1 Pagination Consistency

> Two committed-locally slices on `main` after the milestone deploy. **Not pushed, not deployed.** Production remains at **`3c37cbf`**.

## Task 8.4 — Tier-1 Bulk Workflows (committed `0b74293`)
- **Tier-1, UI-only** bulk workflows on the AI Alt Text Suggestions tab (one view file + its test).
- Bulk **Apply**/**Dismiss** reuse the **existing per-item endpoints** (`POST /admin/proposals/{id}/apply`, `/dismiss`) run sequentially; each item governed individually (own approval gate, `change_id`, rollback). Developer → applied; client/enterprise → `pending_approval`. Per-item failure never aborts the run; progress in a `role=status` region.
- **No batch approval. No batch rollback. No async queue. No cross-page selection. No new backend/schema/operation/capability/MCP tool.**

## S2.1 — Selection & Pagination Consistency (this section's commit)
- **Operations Explorer** moved **away from load-all + client-side filtering** → server-paginated **and** server-filtered (search / risk / available-only applied before pagination).
- **Tokens & Capabilities** token list moved **away from load-all** → server-paginated (the per-token access matrix is now computed only for the page, not the whole manifest; the matrix itself is unchanged — S3 untouched). `capabilities()` (23) and `operations_map()` (34) left as-is (invariant-bounded).
- Both now use the **canonical pagination envelope** shared with Approval Center / Change History / ProposalAdminQuery / AltTextScanQuery:
  `items` · `total_count` · `returned` · `has_more` · `next_cursor` · `limit` · `offset` · `filters`.
  (Tokens also keeps a `total` alias for `DashboardAdminQuery`.)
- Views consume the envelope and add **Prev/Next** pagers; no new REST routes (existing list handlers parse `limit`/`offset`/`cursor`/filters via a shared `list_paging()` helper).
- **S2.2 explicitly deferred:** no cross-page selection · no select-all-matching · no server-side selection contract · no batch approval/rollback.
- **Files (7):** `includes/Admin/OperationExplorerAdminQuery.php`, `includes/Admin/TokenCapabilityAdminQuery.php`, `includes/Admin/AdminRestApi.php`, `includes/Admin/views/operations-explorer.php`, `includes/Admin/views/token-capability-manager.php`, `tests/test-operations-explorer.sh`, `tests/test-token-capability-admin.sh`.

## Invariants (unchanged, live-verified)
OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0**.

## Testing
- `test-alt-text-ui.sh` **69/0**
- `test-operations-explorer.sh` **130/0**
- `test-token-capability-admin.sh` **153/0**
- `test-dashboard.sh` **123/0** (confirms the `tokens()['total']` back-compat alias)
- `tests/run.sh --tier T0 --changed` **253/0 net-new 0** · `--tier T1 --changed` **584/0 net-new 0** (14 suites)

## Deployment
- **Production remains at `3c37cbf`.** S2.1 **not deployed** (and Task 8.4 not deployed). Builder UIs stay build-flag OFF either way.

**Next:** S2.2 (cross-page server-side selection) only on explicit direction — it is the unlock for cross-page bulk; design as select-by-criteria → bounded, capability-scoped, server-resolved id set → existing per-item governed action (no batch primitive).

> **Deploy status update:** Task 8.4 + S2.1 were subsequently **released to production** — prod HEAD = **`9259c7e`** (`git describe` v0.109.0-8-g9259c7e), pull-cron verified, invariants 34/23/40/40/2.5.0, Builder UIs still build-flag OFF. (The "Production remains at 3c37cbf" line above reflects the moment those commits were made, not the later deploy.)

# STEP 112 — S2.2.1 Cross-Page Server-Side Selection (committed locally, NOT pushed)

> The S2.2 "smallest safe slice" from the S2.2 architecture review. Committed on `main`; **not pushed, not deployed.** Production is at `9259c7e`.

## What shipped
A **stateless, read-only selection primitive** that turns "select all matching {filter}" into a bounded, capability-scoped id set — feeding the **existing** per-item governed apply/dismiss. No new operation/capability/MCP tool/schema/persistence/authority/write path.

- **`SelectionContract`** (`includes/Admin/SelectionContract.php`) — stateless value object: `by = ids | criteria`, `filters` (snapshot), `cap` clamped to `HARD_CAP = 100`. Validates `by`; never persisted; no selection table.
- **`SelectionResolver`** (`includes/Admin/SelectionResolver.php`) — **read-only** resolver over the **existing `ProposalStore`** source (`count()`/`list()` only). **Bounded:** when matches exceed `min(cap, MAX_SELECTION = 100)` it **REFUSES** (`over_cap`, empty ids) rather than truncating into a partial mass action. **Capability-scoped:** criteria for an operation outside the caller's `allowed_operations` resolve to nothing. **Whitelisted filters** (`operation_id/status/target_type/batch_id`) — no arbitrary column injection. No alt-text/media literals (surface-agnostic).
- **Route** — `GET /admin/alt-text/selection` (**READABLE only**), gated by the existing `check_alt_text_permission`. Criteria are **fixed server-side** to this surface (`media_manage` drafts); the caller cannot widen scope. AI Alt Text is the **only** wired consumer.
- **AI Alt Text UI** — a "Select all matching" control resolves server-side, previews the count (or shows over-cap refusal / empty), and **persists a cross-page selection across paging**. On Apply/Dismiss it **RE-RESOLVES at action time** and feeds the fresh, bounded id set into the existing per-item `runApply`/`runDismiss` loops. Per-page selection and match-all are mutually exclusive.

## Architecture posture (sanity-reviewed pre-commit)
`SelectionContract` is fully generic; `SelectionResolver` is reusable **unmodified by any proposal-backed governed action** (pass its own `operation_id` + `allowed_operations`). AI Alt Text coupling is **isolated to the route + UI** (the resolver has zero alt-text knowledge). A `SelectionSource` abstraction (for non-proposal sources) is deliberately **deferred to the second consumer** (extract-on-second-use, not speculative generality).

## Four Guarantees — preserved (per item)
Approval (each resolved id → existing per-item apply → its own `pending_approval` in gated modes; **no batch approval**) · Rollback (per-`change_id`; **no batch rollback**) · Audit (existing chokepoint) · Capability scoping (resolver scope + per-item `OperationExecutor`). Bounded execution via `MAX_SELECTION`; re-resolution at action time so actions run against current governed truth.

## Explicitly NOT built (deferred)
Persisted/server-materialized selections · saved selections · batch approval · batch rollback · async queue · selection on Approval Center / Change History · a `SelectionSource` source-abstraction.

## Invariants (unchanged, live-verified)
OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0** (`Schema.php` untouched; no migration; no new table).

## Files (7)
New: `includes/Admin/SelectionContract.php`, `includes/Admin/SelectionResolver.php`, `tests/test-selection-resolver.sh`. Modified: `includes/Admin/AdminRestApi.php` (read route + handler), `includes/Admin/views/ai-alt-text.php` (select-all-matching + id-list bulk loops), `tests/test-alt-text-ui.sh` (+7), `tests/regression-map.tsv` (+`selection` group).

## Testing
- `test-selection-resolver.sh` **48/0** · `test-alt-text-ui.sh` **76/0**
- `tests/run.sh --tier T0 --changed` **89/0 net-new 0** · `--tier T1 --changed` **541/0 net-new 0** (15 suites)

**Next:** deploy decision for S2.2.1, or the next S2.2 increment (server-materialized/saved selections, or extend the resolver to a second governed action) — report-first, on explicit direction.

# S2.2.1 (STEP 112) — DEPLOYED to production (2026-06-19)

> Deployment record for the STEP 112 section above. Supersedes its "committed locally, NOT pushed" status: S2.2.1 is now **live in production**.

## Deployment
- **Commit:** `f5c19ea` — *feat(selection): add bounded cross-page server-side selection (S2.2.1)*
- **Date:** 2026-06-19 · **Model:** Hostinger pull-cron
- **Deploy log:** `DEPLOYED 9259c7e -> f5c19ea active=yes` @ 2026-06-19T14:15:09Z

## Production status
- **Production HEAD = `f5c19ea`** (`git describe` = `v0.109.0-9-gf5c19ea`); `origin == prod == local`.
- Production **healthy** · pull-cron deployment **successful** · **no PHP fatals** (no `debug.log`/`error_log`) · plugin **active**.

## Architecture summary (deployed)
- **S2.2.1 deployed.** `SelectionContract` added (stateless: `by = ids | criteria`, cap clamped to `HARD_CAP = 100`). `SelectionResolver` added (read-only over the existing `ProposalStore`).
- **Cross-page server-side selection** available for **AI Alt Text** ("Select all matching") via the READABLE route `GET /admin/alt-text/selection`.
- **Stateless criteria-based selection** · **capability-scoped resolution** · **refuse-over-cap** (no truncation) · **re-resolve at action time** before feeding the existing per-item apply/dismiss loops.
- **No persistence · no selection table · no batch approval · no batch rollback · no new operations · no new capabilities · no new MCP tools · no schema change.**
- Live verification: selection route auth-gated (anon `401`, not 404); authenticated resolve returns the bounded envelope; **read-only confirmed** (draft count unchanged before/after resolve).

## Invariants (verified live on production)
- **OPERATION_MAP = 34**
- **capabilities = 23**
- **catalogue = 40**
- **MCP tools = 40**
- **DB_VERSION = 2.5.0** (14 `wpcc_*` tables; none added)

## Current production baseline
**Production HEAD: `f5c19ea`**

Latest deployed milestones:
1. Proposal Store primitive
2. AI Alt Text (7A–8.4)
3. S2.1 Pagination Consistency
4. S2.2.1 Cross-Page Server-Side Selection

Current state:
- Builder UIs remain **build-flag OFF** · Governed Drafts **hidden** · AI Alt Text **hidden**.
- **Four Guarantees intact** (approval · rollback · audit · capability scoping).
- Production **stable**.

**Next:** report-first planning of the next architectural task (e.g., next S2.2 increment — server-materialized/saved selections, or a second governed-action consumer of the resolver — or other Phase B/C debt) on explicit direction. **S2.2.2 not started.**

# Governed Action #2 — SEO Meta Generator · Slice 1 (Read-Only SEO Audit) — committed locally, NOT pushed

> The first slice of GA#2, per the GA#2 architecture + SEO-rollback verification reviews. Committed on `main`; **not pushed, not deployed.** Production is at `da95a0f`.

## What shipped (read-only only)
- **Read-only SEO audit** of public content (posts / pages / public CPTs, published): which items are **missing / weak / ok** on SEO title + meta description, with a per-item score.
- **Plugin support via the existing `SeoProvider`:** Rank Math / Yoast / **NONE**. When no supported SEO plugin is active → `provider_available:false`, empty population, Builder shows an empty-state and **no controls**.
- **Canonical pagination envelope:** `items · total_count · returned · has_more · next_cursor · limit · offset · filters` (plus `provider`, `provider_available`, `summary`) — identical to every other list surface.
- **Build flag OFF by default** (`WPCC_SEO_META_UI` const / `wpcc_seo_meta_ui` filter) AND FeatureGate `seo_meta_generator`. Menu `wpcc-seo` hidden until flipped.
- Classification thresholds **mirror `SeoRuntimeManager`** (title ≤60, description 120–160, focus keyword present).

## Explicitly NOT in Slice 1 (later slices)
**No** AI text generation · **no** provider/model call · **no** proposal creation · **no** `seo_update` · **no** approve/apply · **no** undo · **no** bulk/selection · **no** writes of any kind · **no** schema change · **no** new operation/capability/MCP tool.

## Reuse / new
- **Reused:** `SeoProvider` (detect/read/label), the canonical pagination contract, the build-flag + FeatureGate + C1 `gate()` admin patterns, the read-only Builder view pattern.
- **New:** `includes/Seo/SeoAuditQuery.php` (read-only audit), `includes/Admin/views/seo-meta.php` (read-only Builder view), one READABLE route `GET /admin/seo/audit` + `seo_audit()` handler + `check_seo_permission()` (`FEATURE_KEYS['seo']='seo_meta_generator'`), a build-flagged `wpcc-seo` menu, and one **additive read-only** helper `SeoProvider::meta_key()`.

## Four Guarantees & invariants
Four Guarantees untouched (read-only surface; no execution/approval/rollback/audit-write path). Invariants unchanged: OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0** (the `seo` FeatureGate key is a UI Free/Pro seam, not a `CapabilityRegistry` capability).

## Files (7)
New: `includes/Seo/SeoAuditQuery.php`, `includes/Admin/views/seo-meta.php`, `tests/test-seo-audit.sh`. Modified: `includes/Operations/SeoProvider.php` (additive `meta_key()`), `includes/Admin/AdminRestApi.php` (route + handler + gate), `includes/Admin/AdminMenu.php` (build-flagged menu), `tests/regression-map.tsv` (+`seo_audit` group).

## Testing
- `test-seo-audit.sh` **54/0** (dev provider: Yoast)
- `tests/run.sh --tier T0 --changed` **126/0 net-new 0** · `--tier T1 --changed` **299/0 net-new 0**

**Next:** Slice 2 (shared AI text provider + `SeoMetaGenerator` → governed drafts), report-first, on explicit direction. **Slice 2 not started.**

---

# GA#2 SEO Meta Generator — Slice 2a (Shared Anthropic Transport) — committed locally, NOT pushed

> The first half of Slice 2: extract the Anthropic transport (extract-on-second-use) so the vision provider and the future SEO text provider share one outbound path. Committed on `main`; **not pushed, not deployed.** Production is at `ff64e9e`.

## What shipped
- **`AnthropicClient` added** (`includes/Ai/AnthropicClient.php`) — the single low-level Anthropic Messages transport: URL/version/headers/timeout/`wp_remote_post`, key + model resolution, response parsing + HTTP error mapping, Redactor scrubbing, **errors-as-data (never thrown)**. Operation-agnostic: caller supplies `messages` + `max_tokens` + `model`. No prompt construction, no `ProviderResult` coupling, no SEO/alt-text *logic* (architecture-reviewed pre-commit: GO, no required changes).
- **`AnthropicVisionProvider` refactored** to delegate transport to `AnthropicClient` while keeping all vision concerns (image size guard, mime/readable checks, image+text message, WCAG prompt, `ProviderResult` mapping, error codes). **Alt Text behavior preserved** (proven baseline-identical).

## Key / model resolution
- **Canonical shared (new):** `WPCC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `wpcc_anthropic_api_key`, `WPCC_ANTHROPIC_MODEL` / `wpcc_anthropic_model`.
- **Legacy preserved (back-compat):** `WPCC_VISION_API_KEY` / `wpcc_alt_text_api_key`, `WPCC_VISION_MODEL` / `wpcc_alt_text_model`.
- Precedence: canonical constant → canonical option → legacy constant → legacy option (→ caller default for model). One BYO Anthropic key now powers all WPCC AI; existing Alt Text installs keep working unchanged.

## Explicitly NOT in Slice 2a
**No** SEO provider · **no** `SeoMetaGenerator` · **no** SEO generate route · **no** SEO generation · **no** proposals · **no** writes · **no** schema change · **no** new operation/capability/MCP tool.

## Invariants (unchanged)
OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0**.

## Files (5)
New: `includes/Ai/AnthropicClient.php`, `tests/test-anthropic-client.sh`. Modified: `includes/AltText/AnthropicVisionProvider.php` (delegates transport), `tests/test-alt-text.sh` (2 static assertions repointed to the AI transport layer), `tests/regression-map.tsv` (+`ai_transport` group → `test-anthropic-client.sh`).

## Testing
- `test-anthropic-client.sh` **42/0** (not-configured-send path skipped — a key constant is defined on dev)
- `test-alt-text.sh` **baseline-identical: 125/4 vs 125/4** (stash-compare) → behavior unchanged, net-new 0. (The 4 are the chronic "key present on dev" env failures.)
- `tests/run.sh --tier T0 --changed` **96/0 net-new 0** · `--tier T1 --changed` **193/0 net-new 0**

**Next:** Slice 2b (`SeoMetaProvider`/`AnthropicSeoProvider` on `AnthropicClient` + `SeoMetaResult` + `SeoMetaGenerator` → governed drafts via `ProposalStore`, drafts-only, no apply), report-first, on explicit direction. **Slice 2b not started.**

---

# GA#2 SEO Meta Generator — Slice 2b (Governed SEO Draft Generation) — committed locally, NOT pushed

> The second half of Slice 2: AI suggestions → governed DRAFTS on the proposal store. Committed on `main`; **not pushed, not deployed.** Production is at `364011d`.

## What shipped (drafts only)
- **`SeoMetaResult`** — SEO result value object (ok/error + meta_title + meta_description + provenance).
- **`SeoMetaProvider`** (interface) + **`AnthropicSeoProvider`** — consumes the shared `AnthropicClient` (Slice 2a); grounded JSON-only prompt; tolerant `extract_meta()` (bare/fenced/embedded JSON; rejects non-JSON/missing-key — never fabricates).
- **`SeoMetaProviderResolver`** — config-only active-provider selection (non-final test/extension seam).
- **`SeoMetaGenerator`** — provider → `ProposalStore::create` governed draft (`operation_id=seo_manage`, `action=seo_update`, `payload={action:'seo_update', content_id, seo:{title,description}}`, `prior`={current meta}, provenance, batch_id). **`ProposalStore::create` is the only write.**
- **`POST /admin/seo/generate`** (CREATABLE, `check_seo_permission`) + minimal Generate control on the Slice-1 view (per-row select; reports created/skipped/failed).

## Hard boundaries (architecture-verified pre-commit)
- **Explicit `post_ids[]` only.** Handler reads solely `post_ids`; generator's id set = that array, deduped, capped at **`MAX_BATCH=25`**. No criteria/filter/state/"all-matching" generation, **no `SelectionResolver` integration**, no cross-page generation, no audit-filter→server-side expansion. No path creates drafts without explicit ids.
- **Drafts only:** no `seo_update` execution, no `SeoProvider::write`, no `OperationExecutor`/`ProposalApplyService`, no apply, no undo, no approval, no bulk, no site write.
- Two preconditions degrade gracefully (skip): SEO plugin active (`no_seo_plugin`) and AI provider configured (`no_provider`). Per-item failure never aborts the run.

## Invariants (unchanged)
OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0** (no operation/capability/MCP/schema change; drafts are rows in existing `wpcc_proposals`).

## Files (10)
New: `includes/Seo/SeoMetaResult.php`, `includes/Seo/SeoMetaProvider.php`, `includes/Seo/AnthropicSeoProvider.php`, `includes/Seo/SeoMetaProviderResolver.php`, `includes/Seo/SeoMetaGenerator.php`, `tests/test-seo-generate.sh`. Modified: `includes/Admin/AdminRestApi.php` (route+handler), `includes/Admin/views/seo-meta.php` (Generate control), `tests/test-seo-audit.sh` (section-4 guards updated for the drafts control), `tests/regression-map.tsv` (+`seo_generate` group).

## Testing
- `test-seo-generate.sh` **46/0** (stub provider — no real API call) · `test-seo-audit.sh` **55/0**
- `tests/run.sh --tier T0 --changed` **167/0 net-new 0** · `--tier T1 --changed` **264/0 net-new 0**

**Next:** Slice 3 (review/edit/dismiss UI over the existing proposal routes), report-first, on explicit direction. **Slice 3 not started.** Live provider quality (real Anthropic JSON) still needs a manual validation step before relying on real suggestions; prod has no Anthropic key configured.

---

# GA#2 SEO Meta Generator — Slice 3 (SEO Suggestions: Review / Edit / Dismiss) — committed locally, NOT pushed

> UI-only review workflow over the existing proposal platform. Committed on `main`; **not pushed, not deployed.** Production is at `a600432`.

## What shipped (UI-only)
- **Suggestions tab** added to `seo-meta.php` (now tabbed Review | Suggestions). Lists `seo_manage` draft proposals; per row shows post title/type/edit-link · **Current** (`prior`) vs **Suggested** (editable title + description) · live char counts (≤60 / 120–160, advisory) · provider/model attribution · **Edited** indicator.
- **Reuses ONLY the existing proposal routes** — no backend, no new class, no new route:
  - `GET /admin/proposals?operation_id=seo_manage&status=draft` (list)
  - `PUT /admin/proposals/{id}` (edit `final_payload`; draft stays draft)
  - `POST /admin/proposals/{id}/dismiss` (dismiss; terminal)
- **WP core REST** (`/wp/v2/posts` + `/wp/v2/pages` by `include`) used **only** for post-context enrichment (client-side); edit links built client-side. CPT-without-`show_in_rest` degrades to `#id` (edit link still works).
- **`final_payload`-first rendering verified**: `suggested()` prefers `final_payload.seo`, falls back to `payload.seo` only when absent — an edit never reverts to the original AI suggestion after reload.

## Boundaries (architecture-verified, grep counts = 0)
No Apply / Approval-Center / Change-History / Undo / rollback / `/history/` / `OperationExecutor` / `ProposalApplyService` / `SeoProvider::write` / SelectionResolver / bulk apply / bulk dismiss. The single `seo_update` string is the edit's `final_payload.action` **data** (not execution). Save updates `final_payload` only; dismiss terminates the draft only; no SEO meta write. **`ProposalAdminQuery` untouched.**

## Four Guarantees & invariants
Pre-decision / proposal-only / draft-only → Approval · Rollback · Audit · Capability scoping all unchanged (enforced later at apply, Slice 4). Invariants frozen: OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0** (no new route/operation/capability/MCP tool/schema).

## Files (5) — UI + tests only
Modified: `includes/Admin/views/seo-meta.php` (Suggestions tab + JS), `tests/test-seo-audit.sh` + `tests/test-seo-generate.sh` (2 stale view guards repointed to `/apply`+`/history/` since the shared view's scope grew), `tests/regression-map.tsv` (+`seo_review` group). New: `tests/test-seo-review.sh`.

## Testing
- `test-seo-review.sh` **39/0** · `test-seo-audit.sh` **55/0** · `test-seo-generate.sh` **46/0**
- `tests/run.sh --tier T0 --changed` **182/0 net-new 0** · `--tier T1 --changed` **424/0 net-new 0**

**Next:** Slice 4 (approve/apply + undo), report-first, on explicit direction. **Slice 4 not started.** Apply → `ProposalApplyService` → `seo_manage`/`seo_update`; undo → existing change-history rollback (`change_id`→`rollback_id`→`seo_restore`, verified). Slice 5 (bulk) needs `wpcc_seo_rollbacks` store hardening first.

---

# GA#2 SEO Meta Generator — Slice 4a (Apply + Applied) — committed locally, NOT pushed

> Approve/Apply + a read-only Applied tab over the existing governed apply path. UI-only. Committed on `main`; **not pushed, not deployed.** Production is at `5158b47`. (Undo = Slice 4b, NOT started.)

## What shipped (UI-only)
- **Apply** on the Suggestions tab → reuses the existing `POST /admin/proposals/{id}/apply` → `ProposalApplyService::apply()` → `OperationExecutor::run('seo_manage')` → `SeoRuntimeManager::seo_update` → `ChangeRecorder` → `ProposalStore::mark_applied(change_id)`. No SEO-specific apply, no new route/executor/approval path; the UI never calls `seo_manage`/`OperationExecutor` directly.
- **Mode-aware** label from server-rendered `SecurityModeManager::current()`: developer → "Approve & Apply" (immediate); client/enterprise → "Submit for approval" (`pending_approval`). Outcome read from the API response, never assumed from the label.
- **Applied tab** (read-only) reuses the existing proposal list query: three disjoint reads (`status=applied|pending_approval|failed`, `operation_id=seo_manage`), merged + WP-core-REST post enrichment; rollback-aware status via the deployed `ProposalAdminQuery.change_status` ("Applied / Awaiting approval / Failed / Reverted"). No row actions.

## Verified (Final Applied-State Verification: GO)
Real developer apply → status `applied`, `change_id` recorded, change record `rollback_kind=runtime_option` + `rollback_id` present + `reversible=1`, and `seo_update` actually wrote the post meta. Applied/pending/failed all persist across reload + re-query; the 3-read merge is drop-safe (status-disjoint). Provider/model + Current-vs-Suggested render after reload.

## Boundaries (grep-verified 0)
No Undo (`wpcc-seo-undo`), no `/history/` rollback route, no Approval-Center link, no Change-History link, no rollback button, no bulk apply, no SelectionResolver, no direct `seo_manage`/`OperationExecutor` execution, no `SeoProvider::write`. The single `action: 'seo_update'` is the edit's `final_payload` data.

## Four Guarantees & invariants
Approval (per-mode gating via the existing executor) · Rollback (untouched; `rollback_id` preserved for 4b) · Audit (`ChangeRecorder`) · Capability scoping (`seo_manage → content.manage`) — all unchanged; no second path. Invariants frozen: OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0** (no new route/operation/capability/MCP tool/schema).

## Files (6) — UI + tests only
Modified: `includes/Admin/views/seo-meta.php` (Apply button + Applied tab + handlers), `tests/test-seo-review.sh` + `test-seo-audit.sh` + `test-seo-generate.sh` (stale `/apply` "no-apply" guards removed — apply now belongs to 4a; `/history/` undo guards retained), `tests/regression-map.tsv` (+`seo_apply` group). New: `tests/test-seo-apply.sh`.

## Testing
- `test-seo-apply.sh` **39/0** · `test-seo-review.sh` **37/0** · `test-seo-audit.sh` **54/0** · `test-seo-generate.sh` **45/0**
- `tests/run.sh --tier T0 --changed` **227/0 net-new 0** · `--tier T1 --changed` **553/0 net-new 0**

**Next:** Slice 4b (per-item Undo via the existing `/admin/history/{change_id}/rollback` → `seo_restore`), report-first, on explicit direction. **Slice 4b not started.** Slice 5 (bulk) still needs the `wpcc_seo_rollbacks` store hardening first.

# GA#2 Slice 4a — DEPLOYED to production (2026-06-20)

> Deployment record for the Slice 4a section above. **Supersedes its "committed locally, NOT pushed" status:** Slice 4a is now **live in production**.

## Deployment
- **Commit:** `f7c1ca8` — *feat(seo): add governed proposal apply workflow*
- **Date:** 2026-06-20 · **Model:** Hostinger pull-cron
- **Deploy log:** `DEPLOYED 5158b47 -> f7c1ca8 active=yes` @ 2026-06-20T03:55:09Z
- **Pre-deploy gate:** `tests/test-seo-apply.sh` **39 / 0** (live DB, AMPPS env).

## Production status
- **Production HEAD = `f7c1ca8`** (`git describe` = `v0.109.0-15-gf7c1ca8`); **origin == prod == local**, working tree clean.
- Plugin **active** · homepage **200** · **no `debug.log` / no PHP fatals**.

## Verification (all PASS)
- **Routes (anon):** `/admin/dashboard` 401 · `/admin/proposals` 401 · `/admin/seo/audit` 401 · POST `/admin/seo/generate` 401 (`rest_forbidden`, auth-gated — not 404).
- **Slice 4a view (deployed `seo-meta.php`):** Apply control (`wpcc-seo-apply`) present · Applied tab (`wpcc-seo-tab-applied`) present · NO Undo (`wpcc-seo-undo` 0) · no `/history/` (0) · no Approval-Center (0) · no Change-History (0) · no `SelectionResolver` (0) · no `OperationExecutor` (0) · no bulk apply.
- **Invariants (live `wp eval` on prod):** OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0** (`wpcc_db_version` option = 2.5.0).
- **Schema:** **14** `wpcc_*` tables (none added) · no migration ran (`Schema.php` untouched; option matched code → no `dbDelta`).
- **Build flags:** `WPCC_SEO_META_UI` / `WPCC_ALT_TEXT_UI` / `WPCC_PROPOSALS_DEV_UI` all **UNDEFINED → Builder UIs HIDDEN** (SEO Meta / AI Alt Text / Governed Drafts).

## GA#2 progress
Slice 1 (audit) · 2a (AnthropicClient) · 2b (drafts) · 3 (review/edit/dismiss) · **4a (approve & apply + Applied tab)** — all DEPLOYED, Builder UI build-flag OFF throughout. **Next = Slice 4b (per-item Undo), NOT started.** Slice 5 (bulk) still gated on `wpcc_seo_rollbacks` store hardening.

---

# GA#2 Slice 4b — Per-item Undo — DEPLOYED to production (2026-06-20)

Per-item Undo on the SEO Applied tab. **UI-only** (one production file: `seo-meta.php`): an Undo control on applied + reversible (not yet rolled back) rows carrying a `change_id`, reusing the EXISTING governed route `POST /admin/history/{change_id}/rollback` (`change_history → seo_restore`). Developer reverts immediately; client/enterprise route to `pending_approval`. No new route/operation/capability/MCP tool/schema; no backend PHP change. Committed `14a1999` (*feat(seo): add governed per-item undo workflow*), pushed, pull-cron **DEPLOYED to production**; `git describe` = `v0.109.0-17-g14a1999`, plugin active, all admin routes 401, invariants **34/23/40/40/2.5.0**, 14 tables, Builder UIs build-flag OFF. Tests: `test-seo-undo.sh` 33/0 · `test-seo-apply.sh` 39/0 · T0/T1 `--changed` net-new 0.

---

# GA#2 Slice 4c — SEO Rollback Store Hardening — committed locally, NOT pushed

> Backend-only prerequisite for Slice 5 bulk. Committed on `main` as **`<slice-4c-commit>`** (*feat(seo): harden rollback storage for bulk readiness*); **not pushed, not deployed.** Production remains at **`14a1999`**.

## What shipped (Option B — per-post protected meta snapshots)
- **New rollback store:** each SEO rollback snapshot is a dedicated **protected post-meta row** keyed `_wpcc_seo_rb_{rollback_id}` (one row per rollback). Replaces the capped, autoloaded `wpcc_seo_rollbacks` option for new writes — **no global 100-cap, no FIFO eviction, not autoloaded, no shared-blob lost-update race.**
- **`rollback_id`-only restore:** `seo_restore` resolves the snapshot by `rollback_id` alone via one **indexed** `meta_key` lookup → `get_post_meta()` → restore `before_state` → mark `rollback_applied=true` (record kept). The dispatch contract is unchanged (no post_id needed from the caller).
- **Legacy fallback:** if no meta row is found, `seo_restore_legacy()` reads the old `wpcc_seo_rollbacks` option and restores pre-4c records, marking them `rollback_applied=true`. **No migration; the legacy option is left in place** (a draining set; new writes never touch it).

## Preserved / unchanged
Change History route (`/admin/history/{change_id}/rollback`), `ChangeHistoryRuntimeManager`, `OperationExecutor`, `ACTION_ROLLBACKS`, `seo_restore`, `ChangeRecorder`, `ProposalApplyService` — all untouched. **Four Guarantees:** Approval/Audit/Capability scoping unchanged; **Rollback strengthened** (durable, bulk-safe). **No schema change, no DB_VERSION change.**

## Invariants (unchanged, live-verified)
OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0** · **14** `wpcc_*` tables (no migration).

## Files (4) — one production file only
Modified: `includes/Operations/SeoRuntimeManager.php` (the only production change). Tests: `tests/test-seo-rollback-store.sh` (new), `tests/test-seo-audit.sh` (read-only sentinel now store-agnostic), `tests/regression-map.tsv` (+`seo_rollback_store` group). Confirmed UNCHANGED: AdminRestApi · ChangeHistoryRuntimeManager · OperationExecutor · ProposalApplyService · ProposalAdminQuery · Schema · CapabilityRegistry · OperationRegistry · McpServerRuntime.

## Testing
- `test-seo-rollback-store.sh` **28/0** (write/restore-by-id/idempotency/legacy-fallback/no-evict-103/no-option-growth) · `test-seo-apply.sh` **39/0** · `test-seo-undo.sh` **33/0** · `test-seo-audit.sh` **54/0**.
- `T0 --changed` **245/0 net-new 0** · `T1 --changed` **599/0 net-new 0** (a first-run transient flake in `test-change-history-rollback.sh` passed 48/0 standalone + after the store suite; re-run clean — cross-suite env pollution, not a regression).

**Slice 5 prerequisite satisfied:** the rollback store is now bulk-safe (no cap, no eviction, no lost-update, not autoloaded). **Next = deploy decision for 4c, then GA#2 Slice 5 (bulk), NOT started.**

> **Deploy update:** Slice 4c was subsequently **released to production** — prod HEAD = **`529023d`** (`git describe` v0.109.0-18-g529023d), pull-cron verified, invariants 34/23/40/40/2.5.0, 14 tables, Builder UIs build-flag OFF. The protected `_wpcc_seo_rb_` meta store + legacy fallback are live.

# GA#2 Slice 5a — Bulk Apply + Bulk Dismiss — committed locally, NOT pushed

> First increment of GA#2 Slice 5 (bulk). UI-only. Committed on `main`; **not pushed, not deployed.** Production remains at **`529023d`**.

## What shipped (UI-only)
- **Page-scoped bulk action bar on the SEO Suggestions tab:** per-row checkboxes (`wpcc-seo-sg-cb`), *Select all on this page* (`wpcc-seo-sg-selectall`), **Apply selected** (`wpcc-seo-sg-apply`), **Dismiss selected** (`wpcc-seo-sg-dismiss`), and a `role=status`/`aria-live=polite` progress region (`wpcc-seo-sg-progress`).
- **Bulk Apply/Dismiss are SEQUENTIAL loops over the EXISTING per-proposal routes** (`POST /admin/proposals/{id}/apply`, `/dismiss`) — they act only on **checked rows of the current page**. Each item is governed individually (own approval gate, `change_id`, audit, independent Slice-4c rollback snapshot). Developer → applied; client/enterprise → `pending_approval`. Mode-aware confirm; outcome read from each API response, never the mode. **Per-item failure never aborts** (failed rows kept with a message; successful rows removed).

## Boundaries (grep-verified absent in the view)
NO cross-page selection · NO `SelectionResolver` · NO `matchall` / select-all-matching · NO `/admin/seo/selection` · NO bulk **Undo** · NO batch approval · NO batch rollback · NO async/background job · NO direct `OperationExecutor`/`seo_manage`/`SeoProvider::write` · NO new REST route.

## Invariants (unchanged, live-verified)
OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0** (no new route/operation/capability/MCP tool/schema).

## Files (4) — one production file only
Modified: `includes/Admin/views/seo-meta.php` (the only production change). Tests: `tests/test-seo-bulk.sh` (new), `tests/test-seo-apply.sh` (stale "no bulk apply" guard flipped — bulk apply now lives on the Suggestions tab), `tests/regression-map.tsv` (+`seo_bulk` group). `test-seo-review.sh` unchanged (its `lacks SelectionResolver`/`matchall` boundaries remain valid — 5a is page-scoped). Confirmed UNCHANGED: AdminRestApi · ChangeHistoryRuntimeManager · OperationExecutor · ProposalApplyService · ProposalAdminQuery · Schema · CapabilityRegistry · OperationRegistry · McpServerRuntime · SeoRuntimeManager.

## Testing
- `test-seo-bulk.sh` **36/0** (incl. live 3-item apply → 3 distinct `change_id`s + 3 independent `_wpcc_seo_rb_*` snapshots; 2-item dismiss; partial-failure isolation) · `test-seo-apply.sh` **38/0** · `test-seo-undo.sh` **33/0** · `test-seo-audit.sh` **54/0** · `test-seo-review.sh` **36/0**.
- `T0 --changed` **325/0 net-new 0** · `T1 --changed` **727/0 net-new 0** (19 suites; no flake).

**Next = deploy decision for 5a; Slice 5b (cross-page select-all-matching, needs a READABLE `/admin/seo/selection` route) and 5c (bulk Undo) deferred — NOT started.**

> **Deploy update:** Slice 5a was **released to production** — prod HEAD = **`02682dc`** (`git describe` v0.109.0-19-g02682dc), pull-cron verified, invariants 34/23/40/40/2.5.0, 14 tables, Builder UIs build-flag OFF, all routes 401.

# GA#2 UX Polish — Workflow Guidance, Tab Counts, Action Dashboard — committed locally, NOT pushed

> Must-Have UX polish (U1.1/U1.2/U1.3/U1.4/U3) on the SEO Meta Builder. UI-only. Committed on `main`; **not pushed, not deployed.** Production remains at **`02682dc`**.

## What shipped (UI-only)
- **U1.1 intro copy fix:** removed the false "Read-only — this page does not change anything"; the intro now states reviewable / approval-aware / **reversible**.
- **U1.2 Generate → Suggestions handoff:** on successful generation (`created > 0`) the view **auto-switches** to the Suggestions tab; the dashboard footer is the persistent CTA. No more dead-end.
- **U1.4 no-provider notice:** when generation returns `no_provider` (no AI key), a clear inline notice links to **AI Integrations** (reads the existing `skipped[].reason`; zero backend).
- **U1.3 tab count badges:** Review / Suggestions / Applied carry live counts (reuse the existing proposal list route, `limit=1`).
- **U3 action-first dashboard:** progress bar (optimized %) + **Needs you** (clickable **Missing** / **Needs work** → set the audit filter) + **Healthy** (Optimized) + footer **N suggestions ready** / **N applied (reversible)** deep-linking to those tabs.

## Visual QA (real Chrome via Playwright, authenticated dev session)
All states captured and verified: Review, Suggestions, Applied, dashboard card, tab badges, no-provider notice, Generate→Suggestions handoff, mobile (390px — no overflow). Dashboard actions functionally verified (filter switch + tab deep-links). **One double-percent bug found and fixed** ("0%% optimized" → "0% optimized"; `dashPct` `%%`→`%`).

## Boundaries / invariants
No new route/operation/capability/MCP tool/schema; **no backend PHP changed** (only `seo-meta.php`). The new count reads reuse the existing `/admin/proposals` route. Four Guarantees untouched (presentation-only). Invariants frozen: OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0**.

## Files (3) — one production file only
Modified: `includes/Admin/views/seo-meta.php` (only production change), `tests/test-seo-audit.sh` (+14 UX assertions: intro/badges/dashboard), `tests/test-seo-generate.sh` (+5 UX assertions: handoff/no-provider).

## Testing
- `test-seo-audit.sh` **68/0** · `test-seo-generate.sh` **49/0** · siblings green (`test-seo-review.sh` 36/0 · `test-seo-apply.sh` 38/0 · `test-seo-bulk.sh` 36/0 · `test-seo-undo.sh` 33/0).
- `T0 --changed` **330/0 net-new 0** · `T1 --changed` **801/0 net-new 0** (22 suites; no flake).

**Scope = Must-Have only.** Deferred (separate slices, NOT started): U2 audit-table badge relabels + score `/100` + "Suggestion ready" state; **Applied-tab pagination** (the remaining Public-Beta scalability blocker, visually confirmed unbounded in QA); Slice 5b / 5c.

> **Deploy update:** UX Polish was **released to production** — prod HEAD = **`af9d314`** (`git describe` v0.109.0-20-gaf9d314), pull-cron verified, all UX-polish markers live (intro/tab badges/dashboard/no-provider + corrected `%d% optimized`), invariants 34/23/40/40/2.5.0, 14 tables, Builder UIs build-flag OFF, routes 401.

# SEO Meta Applied Tab Pagination — committed locally, NOT pushed

> Fixes the unbounded/truncated Applied tab. UI-only. Committed on `main`; **not pushed, not deployed.** Production remains at **`af9d314`**.

## What shipped (UI-only)
- **Segmented Applied statuses:** the Applied tab now has a 3-segment control — **Applied** (default) · **Awaiting approval** · **Failed** — instead of the old 3-read merge (each capped at `limit=50`, silently truncating).
- **Pagination envelope reuse:** each segment is **one paginated read** over the EXISTING `GET /admin/proposals?operation_id=seo_manage&status={apSeg}&limit=20&offset=N`, consuming the canonical envelope (`total_count/returned/has_more/offset`). Offset-based **Prev/Next** + "**Showing X–Y of N**" (reuses `STR.pageInfo`). Default segment = Applied; switching a segment or re-entering the Applied tab resets offset to 0. WP-core post/page enrichment now per-page (≤20 ids).
- **Preserved:** Undo on reversible Applied rows (Slice 4b), Reverted badge, Applied/Awaiting/Failed rendering — `renderApplied` unchanged; `loadApplied()` kept its name so the Undo handler + tab switch reload the current segment/page transparently.

## No backend / no invariant changes
Only `seo-meta.php` changed in production. **No** new route / multi-status / `status IN` / store change / schema / DB_VERSION / operation / capability / MCP tool. All 9 named backend files byte-identical. Four Guarantees untouched (read-only presentation). Invariants: OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0**.

## Files (3)
Modified: `includes/Admin/views/seo-meta.php` (only production change), `tests/test-seo-apply.sh` (section 2 → segmented + paginated assertions; +4c functional pagination test: 22 applied → page 1 returns 20 + has_more + total≥22, page 2 reachable). `docs/product/SESSION-HANDOFF-2026-06-18.md` (this section).

## Testing
- `test-seo-apply.sh` **56/0** (incl. live >20-record pagination) · `test-seo-undo.sh` **33/0** · `test-seo-bulk.sh` **36/0** · siblings green (audit 68/0, generate 49/0, review 36/0).
- `T0 --changed` **281/0 net-new 0** · `T1 --changed` **607/0 net-new 0** (16 suites; no flake). Live visual smoke (Playwright, authed dev session): default Applied segment, "Showing 1–20 of 133", Next → "21–40 of 133", switch to Awaiting → "1–20 of 37" with 0 Undo (offset reset, no Undo on non-applied).

**Not deployed yet.** Next = deploy decision for Applied-tab pagination. Slice 5b / 5c and other surfaces NOT started.

# GA#2 — SEO Meta Applied Tab Pagination — DEPLOYED to production

- **Commit:** `75e1631` — *feat(seo): paginate applied proposal history*
- **Deployment verified:** pull-cron released; **Production HEAD = `75e1631`** (`git describe` v0.109.0-21-g75e1631), plugin active, homepage/namespace **200**, admin routes **401**, no PHP fatals.
- **What shipped (UI-only):** the Applied tab is now a **segmented single-status paginated list** — **Applied** (default) · **Awaiting approval** · **Failed**. Each segment is one paginated read over the EXISTING `GET /admin/proposals?operation_id=seo_manage&status={seg}&limit=20&offset=N`, **reusing the canonical pagination envelope** (`total_count/returned/has_more/offset`) with offset-based Prev/Next and "Showing X–Y of N". Default = Applied; segment switch / tab entry resets offset to 0.
- **Silent truncation removed:** the old 3-read merge (each `limit=50`) is gone; >20 records in any status now page fully (live-verified "Showing 1–20 of 133" → Next "21–40 of 133").
- **Preserved:** Undo on reversible Applied rows, Reverted badge, all status rendering (`renderApplied` unchanged; `loadApplied` kept its name).
- **No backend / route / schema changes:** only `seo-meta.php` (production); all 9 named backend files byte-identical on prod (`git diff af9d314..75e1631` = view + tests + docs only). **Four Guarantees preserved** (read-only presentation). **Invariants unchanged: 34 / 23 / 40 / 40 / 2.5.0**; **14** `wpcc_*` tables (no migration).
- **Tests:** `test-seo-apply.sh` 56/0 (incl. live >20-record pagination) · siblings green · `T0 --changed` 281/0 net-new 0 · `T1 --changed` 607/0 net-new 0.

**Production baseline is now `75e1631`.** Builder UIs remain build-flag OFF on prod. Next = contextual SEO AI entry points (architecture review) / Slice 5b / 5c — NOT started.

# Contextual SEO Entry Points (Sprint A) — committed locally, NOT pushed

> Posts/Pages/Products list **row action** "Generate SEO Suggestion" → governed draft → SEO Meta → Suggestions. Thin admin wiring only. Committed on `main`; **not pushed, not deployed.** Production remains at **`75e1631`**.

## What shipped (propose-only)
- **New `includes/Admin/SeoRowActions.php`** — registers a **"Generate SEO Suggestion"** row action on `post_row_actions` (Posts + WooCommerce Products) and `page_row_actions` (Pages), plus one `admin_post_wpcc_seo_generate` handler. The handler verifies a **nonce**, checks **`manage_options` + `FeatureGate('seo_meta_generator')` + the SEO Meta UI build flag**, then creates a **governed DRAFT** via the EXISTING `SeoMetaGenerator::generate([id])` and **redirects to SEO Meta → Suggestions** (`?page=wpcc-seo&tab=suggestions&wpcc_seo_gen={code}`).
- **`seo-meta.php`** (UI): reads `?tab=suggestions` (auto-switch) + `?wpcc_seo_gen={code}` → shows a result notice (created / already-exists / no-provider+AI-Integrations link / no-plugin / not-published / failed).
- **`Plugin.php`**: wires `SeoRowActions` in the `is_admin()` bootstrap block (gated, so it only appears when the Builder is enabled).
- **Products only when WooCommerce is active** (`class_exists('WooCommerce')`); action only on **published** content (mirrors the generator's `not_published` skip). Reuses the generator's existing skip handling (`has_open_proposal`/`no_provider`/`no_seo_plugin`).

## Propose ≠ Apply (Four Guarantees intact)
The row action **only creates drafts** — it NEVER applies, NEVER writes SEO meta, NEVER calls `ProposalApplyService`/`OperationExecutor`/`SeoProvider::write`, NEVER bypasses approval/rollback/audit/capability scoping. Review + apply + undo stay in the governed Builder chokepoint. **No new route/operation/capability/MCP tool/schema/DB table/DB_VERSION; no batch primitive.** All 9 contract-backend files byte-identical. Invariants: OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** · DB_VERSION **2.5.0**.

## Files (5)
New: `includes/Admin/SeoRowActions.php`, `tests/test-seo-row-actions.sh`. Modified: `includes/Core/Plugin.php` (admin wiring), `includes/Admin/views/seo-meta.php` (entry notice + Suggestions landing), `tests/regression-map.tsv` (+`seo_row_actions` group).

## Testing + visual validation
- `test-seo-row-actions.sh` **39/0** — visibility matrix (admin+flag+published → present; non-published / unsupported type / FeatureGate-off / subscriber / flag-off → absent), nonce/capability/FeatureGate/flag gates, propose-only round-trip (draft created, **no SEO meta written**, duplicate prevented), invariants. Siblings green.
- `T0 --changed` **345/0 net-new 0** · `T1 --changed` **671/0 net-new 0** (17 suites; no flake).
- **Playwright (authed dev session):** row action present on Posts (20/20 published), Pages (5/5), **Products (7/7, Woo active)**; redirect lands on Suggestions with the green "SEO suggestion created" notice; duplicate + no-provider notices render; no layout regressions. (Drafts correctly show no action.)

**Not deployed yet.** Gated in practice on enabling the SEO Meta Builder UI in production (build-flag OFF). Next = deploy decision; Slice 5b / 5c and editor/Yoast/RankMath metabox integrations NOT started.

> **Deploy update:** Sprint A row actions were **released to production** — prod HEAD = **`a69a2d3`** (`git describe` v0.109.0-23-ga69a2d3), pull-cron verified, `SeoRowActions.php` live + propose-only, invariants 34/23/40/40/2.5.0, 14 tables, no fatals; row action hidden on prod (build-flag OFF, expected).

# Contextual SEO Entry Points (Sprint B) — Bulk Actions — committed locally, NOT pushed

> Native WordPress **Bulk Actions** "Generate SEO Suggestions" on Posts/Pages/Products. Extends the deployed `SeoRowActions`; propose-only. Committed on `main`; **not pushed, not deployed.** Production remains at **`a69a2d3`**.

## What shipped (propose-only)
- **`SeoRowActions` extended** with `bulk_actions-edit-{post|page|product}` (dropdown) + `handle_bulk_actions-edit-{type}` (handler), registered for the same supported types (Products only when Woo active). The handler verifies **capability + FeatureGate + build flag**, sanitizes ids, **caps to `MAX_BATCH ≤ 25`**, calls the EXISTING `SeoMetaGenerator::generate()` (drafts only), and **redirects to SEO Meta → Suggestions** with aggregate counts (`?wpcc_seo_bulk=1&c=&s=&f=&r=`). WP core verifies the bulk nonce before dispatch.
- **`seo-meta.php`**: reads `wpcc_seo_bulk` → shows an aggregate notice ("X created · Y skipped · Z failed"), or the dominant skip reason when nothing was created (no-provider + AI-Integrations link / all-already-exist / no-plugin / not-published).
- **Test seam:** `SeoRowActions` gained a `protected make_generator()` factory (class no longer `final`) so the bulk handler can be tested with a stub provider — no production behavior change.

## Propose ≠ Apply (Four Guarantees intact)
Bulk action **only creates drafts** — never applies/writes meta/calls `ProposalApplyService`/`OperationExecutor`/`SeoProvider::write`/rollback; review+apply+undo stay in the governed Builder. **No new REST route / AJAX / operation / capability / MCP tool / schema / DB table / DB_VERSION; no batch-apply primitive.** `ProposalStore`/`ProposalAdminQuery`/`AdminRestApi` contracts byte-identical. Invariants **34/23/40/40/2.5.0**.

## Files (4)
Modified: `includes/Admin/SeoRowActions.php` (bulk hooks + handler + factory seam; only production logic file), `includes/Admin/views/seo-meta.php` (bulk summary notice), `tests/test-seo-row-actions.sh` (+bulk section), `tests/regression-map.tsv` (trigger extended).

## Testing + visual validation
- `test-seo-row-actions.sh` **64/0** — bulk registration, dropdown gating (admin+flag present; subscriber/flag-off/FeatureGate-off absent or pass-through), **MAX_BATCH (27 → 25 created, overflow dropped)**, **drafts created via bulk (stub provider) with NO SEO meta written**, duplicate bulk → all `has_open_proposal`, redirect to Suggestions. Siblings green.
- `T0 --changed` **366/0 net-new 0** · `T1 --changed` **463/0 net-new 0** (11 suites; no flake).
- **Playwright (authed dev session):** "Generate SEO Suggestions" present in Posts/Pages/**Products** bulk dropdowns; bulk-result landing shows "8 created · 2 skipped · 0 failed" on the Suggestions tab; all-exist + no-provider notices render; no admin regressions.

**Not deployed yet.** Next = deploy decision; editor metabox / Yoast / Rank Math integrations and Slice 5b/5c NOT started.

> **Deploy update:** Sprint B was **released to production** — prod HEAD = **`15bcd6d`** (`git describe` v0.109.0-24-g15bcd6d), pull-cron verified, bulk-action code live + propose-only, invariants 34/23/40/40/2.5.0, 14 tables, no fatals; hidden on prod (build-flag OFF, expected).

# GA#2 Contextual SEO Quick Panel (Option B) — committed this session

> In-context AJAX modal over the EXISTING governed routes; progressive enhancement of the deployed Sprint A row action. Committed on `main` this session and released via pull-cron (production stamp at the end of this section). Production baseline before this work: **`15bcd6d`**.

## Architecture decision — Option B (AJAX modal using existing REST routes)
Progressive enhancement. The "Generate SEO Suggestion" row action stays a working nonce-signed `<a href="admin-post.php?action=wpcc_seo_generate&post=ID">` (no-JS fallback = the existing redirect handler) and gains a `wpcc-seo-quickgen` class + `data-id`/`data-type`. A small enqueued asset intercepts the click, opens an accessible modal, calls `POST /admin/seo/generate {post_ids:[id]}`, then `GET /admin/proposals/{created_id}`, and renders **Current vs Suggested** (title + description). Modal actions only **navigate** (Open in Suggestions / Close). **Drafts only — never applies.** The asset is enqueued ONLY on `edit.php` for supported types (post / page / product-when-Woo), gated by the same `manage_options` + `FeatureGate('seo_meta_generator')` + `WPCC_SEO_META_UI` build flag as the row action.

## Files changed (5)
- **Modified** `includes/Admin/SeoRowActions.php` — anchor gains `wpcc-seo-quickgen` + `data-id`/`data-type` (href fallback intact); new `enqueue_assets()` on `admin_enqueue_scripts` (scoped to `edit.php` + supported type + the row-action gate; localizes REST base + a fresh `wp_rest` nonce + `suggestUrl` + i18n).
- **New** `assets/js/seo-quick-panel.js` — modal logic (generate → fetch created proposal → Current vs Suggested; all skip/failure branches; navigate-only actions; a11y: dialog role, focus trap, ESC, focus restore, `role=status`). Self-aborts if unconfigured (fallback preserved).
- **New** `assets/css/seo-quick-panel.css` — neutral modal; semantic color; `prefers-reduced-motion`; responsive; the `role=status` live region rendered screen-reader-only.
- **New** `tests/test-seo-quick-panel.sh` — 50 assertions.
- **Modified** `tests/regression-map.tsv` — `seo_quick_panel` group (triggers on `SeoRowActions` too, so a shared-file edit runs both the row-action and Quick Panel suites).
- *Asset-path note:* placed under the existing top-level `assets/` root (matches `WPCC_PLUGIN_URL`/`Assets.php`), not `includes/Admin/assets/` as the original plan sketched — convention consistency, single asset root.

## Four Guarantees — verified
- **Approval** — modal only *proposes*; apply stays in the governed Builder (gated modes still route apply → `pending_approval` there).
- **Rollback** — unaffected (no apply/rollback in the modal).
- **Audit** — generation recorded via the existing generator/store chokepoint (the REST route).
- **Capability scoping** — `check_seo_permission` (`manage_options` + FeatureGate) enforced **server-side** on both reused routes; the client gate is convenience only.
- **Propose-only**, same `ProposalStore::create`, **no second proposal system**; admin_post redirect kept as fallback. The JS calls ONLY `POST /admin/seo/generate` + `GET /admin/proposals/{id}` — no `/apply`, `/dismiss`, `/history/`, rollback, `OperationExecutor`, or admin-ajax.

## Invariants — verified (live)
OPERATION_MAP **34** · capabilities **23** · catalogue **40** · MCP tools **40** (live `tools/list`) · DB_VERSION **2.5.0** (14 tables). No new route / operation / capability / MCP tool / schema. All 10 contract-backend files byte-identical to HEAD.

## T0 / T1 / T2 results
- Focused: `test-seo-quick-panel.sh` **50/0** (fallback preserved · enhancement hooks · enqueue gating matrix, 6 cases · drafts-only PHP+JS guards · a11y hooks · invariants).
- **T0 `--changed` 231/0 net-new 0** · **T1 `--changed` 328/0 net-new 0**.
- **T2 (full serial, 129 suites): 5284 passed, 31 failed; run.sh net-new 7 — ALL triaged to 0 attributable.** Of the 7: `test-alt-text` 4 + `test-proposal-admin` 1 = chronic key-present env (reproduced standalone **125/4**, **24/1**); `test-change-history-rollback` 1 + `test-safe-search-replace` 1 = cross-suite pollution (clean standalone **48/0**, **11/0**). Zero failing suites reference the Quick Panel surface. **Attributable net-new = 0.**

## Visual validation summary (Playwright + Chrome, authed dev session, provider = Yoast + live key)
Modal opens (`role=dialog` / `aria-modal=true`); loading → real `claude-sonnet-4-6` **Current vs Suggested** comparison with provenance + a "saved as a draft — nothing has been applied" note; footer = **Open in Suggestions** + **Close** (no apply/undo/approve controls or text); "already exists" state; **ESC** closes and restores focus to the trigger; mobile 390px no overflow. Live enqueue scoping: **present** on post/page/product edit screens, **absent** on dashboard/media/comments/shop_order. **No-JS fallback** (JS disabled): href → `admin-post.php` → redirect to SEO Meta → Suggestions (`wpcc_seo_gen=created`). One QA nit fixed (the `role=status` live region visually duplicated the message → made screen-reader-only).

## Production readiness assessment
- **Engineering: production-ready** — all gates green, net-new 0, no fatals, no drift.
- **Exposure on prod: none until enablement** — the SEO Builder is build-flag OFF, so the row action AND the Quick Panel asset are both hidden until `WPCC_SEO_META_UI` is flipped. This ships dormant.
- Enablement remains gated on (1) an AI key on prod, (2) live-key/prod-provider validation, (3) a security-mode posture choice — config/validation, not code.

## Known limitations
- Hidden on prod (build-flag OFF) — ships dormant; flip the flag + add an AI key to surface the value.
- Modal acts on a single id (the first created proposal); bulk / cross-page generation stays in the WP bulk action and the Builder.
- No in-modal edit/apply by design — review/edit/apply/undo remain in the governed Builder chokepoint.
- On prod (no AI key) the modal would render the `no_provider` state (graceful, with an AI-Integrations link).

## Why Option B over the alternatives
- **vs admin-ajax wrapper (C):** would add a parallel `admin-ajax` action duplicating logic the governed REST routes already expose — more surface, a second code path, zero benefit. Rejected.
- **vs new REST endpoint (D):** would add a route (a contract/invariant surface) for a capability `generate` + `proposals/{id}` already cover 1:1 — violates "no new route," more to certify, no gain. Rejected.
- **vs redirect-only UX (A):** the deployed behavior — functional but dated (navigates away from the list on every click). Option B keeps A as the **no-JS fallback layer** while adding the in-context modal for JS users — best of both, zero backend change.

> **Deploy update:** released to production via pull-cron this session — prod HEAD = **`343d720`** (`git describe` v0.109.0-26-g343d720), plugin active, invariants 34/23/40/40/2.5.0, 14 tables, no fatals; SEO Builder build-flag OFF → row action **and** Quick Panel asset hidden on prod (expected); homepage 200, SEO routes 401. The `343d720` feature commit is the new production baseline (this docs-stamp commit advances git HEAD only).

# ✅ CONSOLIDATED PRODUCTION STATE (authoritative — read this first)

> This block supersedes the per-slice history above for "what is live today." The sections above are the chronological build log.

## Current production
- **Production baseline = `343d720`** (`git describe` = `v0.109.0-26-g343d720`) — the Contextual SEO Quick Panel (Option B) feature commit, released this session. **origin/main == local == prod**; working tree clean. (A docs-stamp commit may advance git HEAD past `343d720`; the feature baseline is `343d720`.)
- **Deploy model:** Hostinger pull-cron on `mosharafmanu.com` — `git push origin main` → live ~1 min. Manual deploy: `ssh -p 65002 u916998506@72.62.68.183` then `bash ~/wpcc-deploy.sh`. Runbook: `.ai/DEPLOY.md`. Prod REST namespace = **`wp-command-center/v1`** (not `wpcc/v1`). Prod plugin path: `~/domains/mosharafmanu.com/public_html/wp-content/plugins/wp-command-center`.
- **Plugin active · homepage/namespace 200 · admin routes 401 · no PHP fatals.**

## Invariants (live-verified on prod, FROZEN)
- **OPERATION_MAP = 34**
- **capabilities = 23**
- **catalogue = 40**
- **MCP tools = 40**
- **DB_VERSION = 2.5.0** (14 `wpcc_*` tables; no migration since 2.5.0)

## Deployed GA#2 SEO Meta Generator — full feature set live at `15bcd6d`
1. **Slice 1** — read-only SEO audit (Rank Math/Yoast via `SeoProvider`).
2. **Slice 2a/2b** — shared `AnthropicClient` transport + governed AI **draft generation** (`SeoMetaGenerator` → `ProposalStore::create`, drafts only, `MAX_BATCH=25`).
3. **Slice 3** — Suggestions review / edit (`final_payload`) / dismiss.
4. **Slice 4a** — Approve & Apply (mode-aware) + Applied tab.
5. **Slice 4b** — per-item **Undo** (reuses `/admin/history/{change_id}/rollback` → `seo_restore`).
6. **Slice 4c** — **rollback-store hardening**: per-post protected meta `_wpcc_seo_rb_{rollback_id}` + legacy-option fallback (no cap/eviction/lost-update; not autoloaded).
7. **Slice 5a** — page-scoped **Bulk Apply / Bulk Dismiss** (sequential, per-item governed).
8. **UX Polish** — corrected intro, Generate→Suggestions handoff + auto-switch, no-provider notice, tab count badges, action-first dashboard (progress bar + clickable Missing/Needs-work + deep links).
9. **Applied Tab Pagination** — segmented single-status (Applied/Awaiting/Failed) paginated list (canonical envelope; replaced the unbounded 3-read merge).
10. **Sprint A — Contextual Row Actions** — "Generate SEO Suggestion" on Posts/Pages/Products rows → governed draft → redirect to Suggestions. (`includes/Admin/SeoRowActions.php`.)
11. **Sprint B — Bulk Actions** — "Generate SEO Suggestions" in the WP Bulk Actions dropdown on Posts/Pages/Products → governed drafts (≤25) → redirect with aggregate counts. (Same `SeoRowActions` class.)
12. **Contextual SEO Quick Panel (Option B)** — in-context AJAX modal on the row action (progressive enhancement; admin_post redirect = no-JS fallback) → `POST /admin/seo/generate` + `GET /admin/proposals/{id}` → Current vs Suggested, navigate-only (drafts). (`includes/Admin/SeoRowActions.php` + `assets/js|css/seo-quick-panel.*`.)

All of the above are **propose-or-governed** — every mutation flows through the single `OperationExecutor`/`ProposalApplyService`/`change_history` chokepoint. Contextual entry points (Sprint A/B) are **propose-only** (drafts).

## Build-flag status (production)
- `WPCC_SEO_META_UI` — **OFF** → SEO Meta Builder page AND its row/bulk entry points are **hidden** on prod.
- `WPCC_ALT_TEXT_UI` — OFF. `WPCC_PROPOSALS_DEV_UI` — OFF.
- Local dev enables these via `wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcc-dev-*.php` (outside the repo, never committed/deployed). `wpcc-dev-seo-meta-ui.php` exists on dev.

## Known limitations (production)
- **No AI provider key on prod** (`WPCC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` unset) → generation returns `no_provider`; the value path (generate→apply) cannot produce suggestions until a key is configured. **Hard prerequisite for enablement.**
- **Security mode = `developer`** on prod → apply is **immediate** (no approval gate; still reversible + audited). For agency/client use, switch to `client`/`enterprise` so apply → `pending_approval`.
- **No live-key, prod-provider (Rank Math) generation-quality validation** has been run on prod.
- **Deferred UX (cosmetic):** U2 — audit-table badge relabels, score as `/100`, cross-tab "Suggestion ready" indicator; Applied segment-label counts.
- **Scale gap:** cross-page bulk selection (5b) not built — bulk is page-/selection-scoped (≤25 / current page). No unbounded surfaces remain.
- **Supportability:** no usage/cost metering, no error telemetry (relies on UI notices + append-only audit log).

## Completed (SEO Meta Generator — UX feature-complete)
- ✅ **Contextual SEO Quick Panel (Option B)** — COMPLETE & deployed this session (in-context AJAX modal; propose-only; no backend/route/invariant change).
- ✅ **Sprint A — Contextual Row Actions** — COMPLETE & deployed (`a69a2d3`).
- ✅ **Sprint B — Bulk Actions** — COMPLETE & deployed (`15bcd6d`).

With the Quick Panel, the SEO Meta Generator is **UX feature-complete**: audit → generate → review/edit → approve & apply → undo → page-scoped bulk → contextual row/bulk entry → in-context Quick Panel. Every surface preserves the Four Guarantees.

## Remaining roadmap (ranked by business impact)
1. **Production Enablement** (configure AI key + flip `WPCC_SEO_META_UI`) — unlocks all shipped value; **gated on the key + validation**.
2. **Real-world Validation** (prod Rank Math + real key; approval + rollback round-trips) — prerequisite to public beta.
3. **Cross-page Selection (5b)** — agency-scale bulk (server-resolved select-all-matching → existing per-item governed apply).
4. **Design System / Modern UI** — identity/trust polish (Phase C foundations).
5. **Bulk Undo (5c)** — convenience.
6. **Editor Metabox / Rank Math / Yoast** in-metabox — deferred (complexity / provider coupling).

## Recommended next step
The SEO Meta Generator is **UX feature-complete**; there is no remaining UX gap to close. The recommended next step is **Production Enablement + Real-world Validation** (#1–#2) — a **product/config call** (AI key on prod + live-key/prod-provider validation + security-mode posture), not an engineering task. If continuing to build instead, the next *engineering* increment is **Cross-page Selection (5b)** (the only remaining scale gap), followed by **Design System / Modern UI** (Phase C). **Do not start a new feature without explicit direction.**

# 🚀 NEXT SESSION START HERE

## Current architecture state
- SEO Meta Generator is **UX feature-complete and deployed** (see consolidated state above), now including the **Contextual SEO Quick Panel (Option B)** released this session. The governed pipeline (Propose → capability → approval → execute → audit → reversible) is intact across every surface.
- **Contextual entry points:** the row action is a nonce-signed `<a href="admin-post.php?action=wpcc_seo_generate&post=ID">` (no-JS fallback) handled by `SeoRowActions::handle()` → `SeoMetaGenerator::generate([id])` (drafts only) → `wp_safe_redirect` to SEO Meta → Suggestions; when JS is present the **Quick Panel** intercepts the click and shows Current vs Suggested in an in-context modal (same generator, drafts only). Bulk uses `bulk_actions-edit-{type}` / `handle_bulk_actions-edit-{type}` → same generator → redirect with counts.
- **Reusable governed routes available to admin JS** (cookie + `wp_rest` nonce, gated by `check_seo_permission` = `manage_options` + `FeatureGate('seo_meta_generator')`):
  - `POST /wp-command-center/v1/admin/seo/generate` — body `{post_ids:[…]}` → `{created:[proposal_id…], skipped:[{post_id,reason}], failed:[{post_id,code,message}], provider, model, batch_id}`.
  - `GET /wp-command-center/v1/admin/proposals/{id}` (36-char uuid) → shaped proposal incl. `payload`, `final_payload`, `prior`, `provider`, `model` (the suggested vs current text).
  - `GET /wp-command-center/v1/admin/proposals?status=draft&operation_id=seo_manage&…` — list.

## Current production readiness assessment
- **Engineering: production-ready** (all slices tested + visually validated; T0/T1 net-new 0; no prod fatals).
- **Enablement: NOT yet** — blocked on (1) **AI key on prod**, (2) **live-key/prod validation**, plus a **security-mode** posture choice. These are config/validation, not code defects.
- **Recommendation:** validate first, then enable. The SEO UX is now **feature-complete** (Quick Panel shipped) — no UX work remains before enablement.

## Next recommended task — Production Enablement + Real-world Validation (product/config call)
The SEO Meta Generator is **UX feature-complete** (audit → generate → review/edit → apply → undo → bulk → contextual row/bulk entry → in-context Quick Panel). There is no remaining UX gap. The next step is **not** an engineering task — it is a **product/config decision**:
1. **Production Enablement** — configure an AI key on prod (`WPCC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and flip `WPCC_SEO_META_UI` to surface the (already-deployed, currently dormant) Builder + row/bulk/Quick Panel entry points.
2. **Real-world Validation** — with the prod provider (Rank Math) + a real key, exercise generate → approve/apply → undo round-trips; pick a security-mode posture (`developer` immediate vs `client`/`enterprise` → `pending_approval`).

If continuing to **build** instead of enable, the next *engineering* increment is **Cross-page Selection (5b)** — the only remaining scale gap (server-resolved select-all-matching → existing per-item governed apply; reuses `SelectionResolver`; no batch primitive) — followed by **Design System / Modern UI** (Phase C). **Do not start a new feature without explicit direction.**

## Guardrails that still apply to any next SEO work
- **Reusable governed routes for admin JS** (cookie + `wp_rest` nonce, gated by `check_seo_permission` = `manage_options` + `FeatureGate('seo_meta_generator')`): `POST /admin/seo/generate {post_ids:[…]}`; `GET /admin/proposals/{id}` (shaped: `payload`/`final_payload`/`prior`/`provider`/`model`); `GET /admin/proposals?status=draft&operation_id=seo_manage`.
- **Four Guarantees are non-negotiable** — every mutation flows through `ProposalApplyService`/`OperationExecutor`/`change_history`; Propose ≠ Apply.
- **Invariants frozen: 34 / 23 / 40 / 40 / 2.5.0.** No new route / admin-ajax / operation / capability / MCP tool / schema / DB_VERSION without an explicit, reviewed decision.
- **Backend contract files that stay byte-identical for UI-only work:** `AdminRestApi`, `ProposalStore`, `ProposalAdminQuery`, `OperationExecutor`, `ChangeHistoryRuntimeManager`, `SeoRuntimeManager`, `Schema`, `CapabilityRegistry`, `OperationRegistry`, `McpServerRuntime`.
- **Test discipline:** `tests/run.sh --tier T0|T1 --changed` net-new 0 → pristine serial **T2** before deploy. Note: run.sh's auto net-new over-reports on dev-with-key (alt-text / proposal-admin) and under serial pollution (change-history-rollback / safe-search-replace) — triage standalone before treating as a regression.

# 📋 NEW CHAT BOOTSTRAP PROMPT (copy-paste to resume)

```
WP Command Center — resume from SESSION-HANDOFF-2026-06-18.md

Read docs/product/SESSION-HANDOFF-2026-06-18.md in full, especially the
"CONSOLIDATED PRODUCTION STATE" and "NEXT SESSION START HERE" sections.

Authoritative state to confirm before any work:
- Production baseline = 343d720 (git describe v0.109.0-26-g343d720);
  origin/main == local == prod; tree clean. (Quick Panel feature commit.)
- Invariants FROZEN: OPERATION_MAP 34 · capabilities 23 · catalogue 40 ·
  MCP tools 40 · DB_VERSION 2.5.0 (14 wpcc_* tables, no migration).
- Deploy = Hostinger pull-cron: `git push origin main` -> live ~1 min.
  SSH: ssh -p 65002 u916998506@72.62.68.183 ;
  prod path ~/domains/mosharafmanu.com/public_html/wp-content/plugins/wp-command-center ;
  prod REST namespace = wp-command-center/v1 ; runbook .ai/DEPLOY.md.
- SEO Meta Builder + Sprint A row actions + Sprint B bulk actions + the
  Contextual SEO Quick Panel (Option B AJAX modal) are DEPLOYED but build-flag
  OFF on prod (WPCC_SEO_META_UI undefined). Prod has NO AI key and
  security_mode=developer; provider=Rank Math. SEO Meta Generator is UX
  feature-complete.
- Local dev enables the Builder via wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcc-dev-seo-meta-ui.php
  (outside the repo). Tests: tests/run.sh --tier T0|T1 --changed ; gate net-new 0
  vs tests/regression-baseline.tsv ; full serial T2 before deploy.
- Visual checks: Playwright + Chrome are available; authenticate by minting an
  auth+logged_in cookie for the admin via wp eval (no password). Local site:
  http://localhost/ClientProjects/WordPress/2026/plugins-dev .

NEXT STEP (no new feature without direction): the SEO Meta Generator is UX
feature-complete (Quick Panel shipped). The recommended next step is a
PRODUCT/CONFIG call, not engineering:
  1. Production Enablement — set WPCC_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY on prod + flip
     WPCC_SEO_META_UI to surface the already-deployed (dormant) SEO Builder +
     row/bulk/Quick Panel entry points.
  2. Real-world Validation — prod provider (Rank Math) + real key: generate ->
     approve/apply -> undo round-trips; choose security-mode posture.
If building instead: next engineering increment = Cross-page Selection (5b),
then Design System / Modern UI (Phase C). Preserve the Four Guarantees and the
frozen invariants 34/23/40/40/2.5.0; no new route/admin-ajax/operation/
capability/MCP tool/schema without an explicit reviewed decision.

Work report-first: architecture verification -> implementation -> tests
(focused + T0/T1 --changed net-new 0) -> Playwright visual -> commit on approval
-> push -> pull-cron deploy -> production verification. Do not change build flags
or enable the Builder UI on prod unless explicitly asked.
```

*Handoff consolidated; documentation only — no code, no commits, no deploy in this update.*
